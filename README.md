# TOP-File-Uploader

A stripped down version of Google Drive. Users can CRUD (create, read, update, delete) folders, then upload files in them. Files can be downloaded or shared with others via a link that expires after 1 day.

The files are securely uploaded to Supabase Storage via signed URLs. Users are tracked with session-based authentication. Application site and database is deployed using Railway.
