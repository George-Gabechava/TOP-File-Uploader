# TOP-File-Uploader

A stripped down version of Google Drive. Users can CRUD (create, read, update, delete) folders and upload files in them. Files can then be shared with others via a link that expires after 1 day.

The files are securely uploaded to Supabase Storage via signed URLs. The users are temporarily stored via session management. Application site and database is deployed using Railway.
